# State-Space Kinetic Ising Model

This repository provides Python code for analyzing **non-stationary and nonequilibrium** neuronal spiking activity using a state-space kinetic Ising model. The model captures time-varying firing rates and causal couplings, enabling the estimation of **time-asymmetric** (nonequilibrium) dynamics such as entropy flow.

## Requirements

- **Python version**: Tested on **Python 3.8.10** (should work on 3.8+)
- Recommended libraries:
  - **numpy**
  - **matplotlib**
  - **scipy**
  - **joblib** or **numba** (optional; can speed up certain computations)
