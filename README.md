# State-Space Kinetic Ising Model

This repository provides Python code for analyzing **non-stationary and nonequilibrium** neuronal spiking activity using a state-space kinetic Ising model. The model captures time-varying firing rates and causal couplings, enabling the estimation of **time-asymmetric** (nonequilibrium) dynamics such as entropy flow.

## Requirements

- **Python version**: Tested on **Python 3.8.10**
- Recommended libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scipy
  - joblib or numba (if used)
